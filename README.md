# ResumeMindAI CLI

AI-powered resume analysis tool built for IT professionals, freelancers, and consultants. Transform your resume into structured knowledge graphs using GraphRAG technology with multi-provider LLM support.

## What It Does

ResumeMindAI CLI converts your resume into a **structured knowledge graph** that captures entities (skills, companies, projects) and their semantic relationships. This enables intelligent analysis and optimization of your professional profile.

- **Consultants**: Optimize professional profiles for client presentations
- **Job Seekers**: Prepare for interviews with structured skill analysis
- **Career Development**: Make data-driven decisions about your professional growth

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for FalkorDB graph database)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ResumeMindAI-Cli
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Start the graph database:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts FalkorDB with web interface accessible at `http://localhost:3010`

4. **Run the application:**

```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

### The Resume ‚Üí Graph Pipeline

1. **üìÑ Upload Resume**: Supports PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT formats
2. **üßπ AI Cleaning**: Standardizes and formats content using LLM
3. **üìä Section Parsing**: Automatically detects education, experience, skills, projects
4. **üß† Graph Extraction**: AI agents extract entities and relationships
5. **üë§ Human Review**: Interactive validation and refinement of extracted data
6. **üî¢ Vector Embeddings**: Generate semantic embeddings for search
7. **üíæ Graph Storage**: Store in FalkorDB for querying and analysis

### First Time Setup

On your first run, you'll configure an LLM provider:

- **Provider Name**: Custom name (e.g., "My GPT-4", "Local Ollama")
- **Model**: Any LiteLLM-supported model (`gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `ollama/llama3.2`)
- **API Key**: Required for cloud providers, optional for local models
- **Base URL**: Optional (e.g., `http://localhost:11434` for Ollama)
- **Embedding Model**: Auto-selected or custom (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`, `ollama/nomic-embed-text`)

### Main Menu Options

After setup, you'll see the main menu:

```text
üéØ ResumeMindAI - Main Menu
1. üìÑ Resume Ingestion - Process and analyze your resume
2. ü§ñ Manage Providers - Add, switch, or configure LLM providers
3. ‚ùå Exit
```

### Resume Ingestion Process

1. **Select Resume File**: Choose your PDF, DOCX, or TXT resume
2. **AI Processing**: Watch as the system processes each section
3. **Review Extracted Data**: Validate triplets (relationships) found in your resume
4. **Refine Results**: Add missing information or remove incorrect data
5. **Graph Storage**: Approve final results for storage in the knowledge graph
6. **üåê View Graph**: Access FalkorDB web interface at `http://localhost:3010` to explore your resume graph visually

The human-in-the-loop review ensures accuracy - you have full control over what gets stored.

### üîç Exploring Your Resume Graph

After processing your resume, you can visualize and query your knowledge graph:

- **Web Interface**: Open `http://localhost:3010` in your browser
- **Visual Exploration**: See entities (skills, companies, projects) and their relationships
- **Graph Queries**: Run Cypher queries to analyze your professional data
- **Interactive Navigation**: Click through connected nodes to explore relationships
